A minimal CI/CD pipeline involves several stages, including source code fetching, automated CI triggering, QA approval, and deployment to Kubernetes.
Below is a conceptual diagram and explanation for a simple CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Git, Helm, Docker, and Kubernetes.

CI/CD Pipeline Overview:
--------------------------
Source Code Repository Structure:

Copy code
- src/
- helm/
- Dockerfile
- Jenkinsfile
- pom.xml

Branching Strategy:
Main Branch (main or master):
Represents the production-ready code.Directly deployable to the production environment.
Feature Branches:
Created for new features or bug fixes.Merged into the main branch after QA approval.

Here in our case assume the code is already pushed to Master branch .

CI Triggering:

Automated CI:
Jenkins monitors the main branch for changes.On each push to the main branch, Jenkins triggers the CI pipeline.

CI Pipeline:

Stages:
Build:
    Compile code.
    Execute unit tests.
    Build Docker image.

Automated Testing:
    Run automated tests.
    Ensure code quality.
    
Artifact Generation:
    Generate any artifacts needed for deployment.For example, Helm charts.
   
Artifact Archiving:
  Archive generated artifacts.

QA Approval Workflow:
   Manual QA Approval:
     After successful CI, the pipeline pauses for QA approval.QA personnel review the artifacts and approve for deployment.
  Automated QA Testing (Optional):
     Optionally, include an automated QA testing stage before manual approval.

CD Triggering:
  Deployment Trigger:
    Upon QA approval, the deployment stage is triggered.

CD Pipeline:
Stages:
   Deploy to Kubernetes:
     Use Helm to deploy the application to Kubernetes.Deploy to a staging environment for final testing.
   Manual Verification (Staging):
     Allow for manual verification in the staging environment.

Promote to Production:
   If manual verification in staging is successful, promote to the production environment.

Tools Used:
Source Code Management (SCM): Git
Continuous Integration: Jenkins
Artifact Management: Jenkins (Artifacts stored for deployment)
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes
Infrastructure as Code: Helm (for Kubernetes deployment)

The above pipeline can be achieved using different services offered by several cloud providers like AWS, GCP & Azure.
