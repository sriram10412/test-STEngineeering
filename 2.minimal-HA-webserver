The High availability of a  webserver represents the appication should be accessible at any point even in the case of infra failures.
To achieve this , we can include multiple components in the designing of the web server like Load balancing, and a proper Disaster recovery mechanisms to takcle the failure by smooth failovers.
The below are the architecture components involved in the design of HA web application.
------------------------------------------------
Architecture Components:
------------------------------------------------
Web Servers:
Multiple web server instances hosting the web application.Configured identically to enable seamless failover.
Requests are spread across these servers by the load balancer.

DB servers:
For dynamic web applications, a database server is often included.Ensures data consistency across multiple instances.Might use database replication for high availability.

Load Balancer:
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple web server instances.Ensures even distribution of requests to prevent overloading any single server.
In the event of a failure, the load balancer redirects traffic to healthy servers.

Storage and File Replication:
Shared storage for static files or assets.Replicate files across multiple servers for redundancy.

Monitoring System:
Continuous monitoring of server health and performance.Alerts configured to notify administrators of potential issues.

Autoscaling:
Auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.Can add or remove instances based on predefined conditions.

------------------------------------------------
Mechanisms for Handling Infrastructure Failures:
------------------------------------------------
Load Balancer Health Checks:
Regularly checks the health of individual servers.If a server fails the health check, it is temporarily taken out of the load balancing rotation.

Database Replication:
For databases, replication ensures data consistency and availability.A standby database can take over in case of the primary database failure.

File Replication:
Replicating static files across servers ensures availability even if one server goes down.

Disaster Recovery Plan:
A comprehensive plan outlining procedures to recover from major outages.Includes steps for restoring services, data, and configurations.

Server Redundancy:
Multiple web server instances provide redundancy.If one server fails, the load balancer directs traffic to the healthy servers.

Regular Testing:
Regularly test the failover mechanisms and disaster recovery procedures.Ensure that the system behaves as expected during simulated failures.

Data Backups:
Regularly scheduled data backups to prevent data loss in case of a catastrophic failure.Backups can be stored in a separate, resilient location.

Automated Failover:
Automated failover mechanisms detect failures and initiate corrective actions.For example, a failed web server can trigger the load balancer to reroute traffic to healthy servers.

These are the things which i take care during the designing of a HA architechture of an Application. This may not be 100 % acccurate, as there are still some chance of downtime due to the 
failure of any protection measure. These are the steps helps to minimize the downtime of an application.
